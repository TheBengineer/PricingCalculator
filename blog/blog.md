# Calculating Price Efficiency of Virtualized Workloads

### **No one wants to pay extra, especially when reducing cost can be as simple as a few clicks.**

Most of the modern web is hosted in the cloud, on virtual machines (VMs). 
This allows these workloads to be quickly and easily moved from one server to another,
or even from one data center to another.
A website for a small business might only need a tiny slice of a server, while a video streaming service needs 
multiple aisles of servers.
All this flexibility makes it hard to know if you're getting the best deal for your workload.

**A few simple tools and some public data can help you save 30%-90% on your workloads**

## Low Hanging Fruit
The first step of the analysis is to choose the right server family for your workload.
### **What is a server family?**
Over the past decade, cloud providers have released multiple generations of servers, 
each with different hardware and performance characteristics.
The prices vary, but not always in a way that reflects the performance.

**By comparing expected performance to price, we can find often overlooked hardware.**

As faster and more powerful hardware is released, 
there's a tendency for the market to shift towards the latest and greatest,
leaving the older hardware underutilized.

### **How to compare server families?**

We at Tenasol developed a simple webapp that allows you to compare the price of different server families in the GCP cloud.
This allows you to quickly see which server families might be most cost-effective for your workload.
